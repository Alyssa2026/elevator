/*------------------------------------*\
|    Elevator Procedure Descriptions   |
\*------------------------------------*/

-- We provide the source code for 5 different procedures in elevator.frg. 
--   Based on the code and its comments, what documentation do you think would best describe each procedure? 
--   Think about the differences between the procedures and how to best communicate them. 

-- Procedure 1:
-- This procedure establishes when to not move and that moving down is prioritized
--  // The elevator should not move when there are no requests
	// This procedure puts priority of picking up request on the floor it is on
	// If there exists ANY requests below the current location means the elevator shall not move up
	// If there are no requests below the current floor, it shall not move down
	// Moving down is prioritized, you can't move up if there's a request below

-- Procedure 2:
--   This procedure describes continuous motion requirement of the elevator 
	// The elevator is moving continuously
	// it will pick up ppl on the way when there is a request at the current floor
	// Establishes that it can not move down until it is at the top, and it can not move up until it reaches the bottom
	// You can't move down from the bottom floor, and you can't move up from the top floor.

-- Procedure 3:
--  This ensures we will complete requests in one direction, and only swtich after one direction is completed 
	// Has the same initial requirements as 1,4,5 
	// Ensure that requests in one direction stays consistent and does not change direction until all upward or downward requests are completed
	// Like procedure 2, except request based. It won't switch directions until the requests in that direction are completed.

-- Procedure 4:
--   Enforces completing and adding each request individually 
	// Has the same initial requirements as 1,3,5 
	// This enforces that we must complete each request individually to prevent completing multiple requests
	// Always pick up a new request (not in current requests), if it is on the way to the next request.
	// Once a request is completed, the next request will change.
	// If there is not next request, we default to go to the botoom

-- Procedure 5:
--   Allow to complete current and new requests when already moving in that direction
	// Has the same initial requirements as 1,4,3
	// Once we reach a requested floor, we open
	// if last direction is up
		// we will allow  and complete for new requests that are above
		// If the last direction is down, if there are new requests below, we complete taem

-- TODO: encode a few predicates to test the properties of the overall model
--   and verify whether or not they hold in the following test-expect block
